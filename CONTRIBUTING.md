# Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute and to make this project even better than it is today! If this interests you, please begin by reading the project [Wiki documentation](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki). Once you consulted them and you believe that you can help us with new features, improvement or even fixes then go ahead and submit a Pull Request.

Before accepting any Pull Request, we need to make sure that you followed these steps:
1. Have you tested all your changes?
   - you can test `Aurelia-Slickgrid` by going into the folder `aurelia-slickgrid/aurelia-slickgrid`, run  `npm install` and finally run `npm run start:dev` (or even easier if you use Visual Studio Code, just run the task "Start Library Development")
2. Have you run the TypeScript Build?
   - you can run the build with `npm run build` (or with VSCode, run the task "Build Library")
3. If you did step 1 and 2, then the final step would be the Pull Request... but wait, for the Pull Request to be easier to read through, I ask you to remove (if possible) all the `dist` folder that got produced by the "Build Library". We just want to see the real changes, nothing else.
