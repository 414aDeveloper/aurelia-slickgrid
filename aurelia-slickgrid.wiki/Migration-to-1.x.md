## Migration (from 0.x to 1.x)
### Breaking Changes
Since the version `1.x` is a complete rewrite, there are some drawbacks which we will discuss. By dropping [Slickgrid-ES6](https://github.com/DimitarChristoff/slickgrid-es6) dependency, it means introducing couple of breaking changes (that is, if you were using previous version). Also, the modules that you can import are different and the `Frozen` grid is gone.

### So, why the rewrite?
Mostly because the [Slickgrid-ES6](https://github.com/DimitarChristoff/slickgrid-es6) repo (which is maintained by 1 person, which mainly does `React` stuff) is not as maintained, neither stable, as the most active [6pac fork](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid). Also, I now have another repo for `Angular 4+` as well ([Angular-Slickgrid](https://github.com/ghiscoding/Angular-Slickgrid)) which I also maintain (that one is for work though) and is based on the [6pac fork](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid) fork as well. I prefer the 6pac fork for it's stability, list of available functionalities and samples (I even made a few PRs on that fork as well), which the `ES6` fork lacks. The goal is to make both `Angular-Slickgrid` and `Aurelia-Slickgrid` on par (feature wise) and in synch, also since it is used and developed at my work, it will grow much faster.
